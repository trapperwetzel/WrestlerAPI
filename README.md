# WrestlerAPI

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> This project is under active development. Major features, including a PostgreSQL database and automated daily data updates, are planned.

## Overview

WrestlerAPI is a full-stack web application for exploring professional wrestling championship data across multiple promotions.  
It consists of a Node.js/Express backend for data aggregation and a React frontend for interactive data exploration.

### Current Data Pipeline

- The backend uses Node.js scripts to fetch data from various Wiki APIs (WWE, AEW, etc.).
- These scripts merge and clean the fetched data, producing a consolidated JSON dataset.
- **The main dataset is generated by running `index.js`, which imports and executes the buildDataset function.**  
  This builds the complete dataset from all sources and outputs it as a JSON file.
- The React frontend reads from this generated JSON file, providing filtering, sorting, and detailed exploration of wrestling history.

#### Example: How the dataset is built

```js
// index.js
import buildDataset from "./helpers/duplicates/mergeDuplicates.js";
buildDataset(); // Aggregates data from all fetchers into a single JSON file
```

## Planned Improvements

- **Database Integration:**  
  Migrate to a PostgreSQL database for persistent, queryable storage.
- **Automated Data Updates:**  
  Implement a daily fetch from the Wiki API to keep the database current.
- **Data Flow After Upgrade:**  
  Wiki API (daily fetch) → PostgreSQL → WrestlerAPI backend → React frontend

## Features

- Multi-promotion data aggregation
- Name deduplication for wrestlers with multiple aliases
- REST API endpoints (planned)
- Interactive React frontend:
  - Filter, sort, and expand wrestler and championship stats
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Technology Stack

**Backend:**  
- Node.js, Express.js
- JSDOM, node-fetch
- **PLANNED** PostgreSQL integration.

**Frontend:**  
- React 19, Vite
- React Query, React Data Table, Framer Motion, Styled Components, Bootstrap

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/trapperwetzel/WrestlerAPI.git
   cd WrestlerAPI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Build the dataset and start the servers:

   ```sh
   node index.js    # Generates the dataset JSON file
   npm run dev      # Starts both backend and frontend servers
   ```

   - Backend: http://localhost:5000  
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
